# SQL-PowerBI

## Data
This project uses data from the AdventureWorks Sample Databases for SQL Server which can be found [here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms) All of the data cleaning and data extraction was done in SQL Server.

## Business Request
- Improve internet sales reports and move them from static reports to visual dashboards
- Focus on how much we have sold of what products, to which clients and how it has been over time
- Filter by customers and products sold
- Measure numbers against the budget to compare values against performance
- Budget is for 2024 and usually look back 2 years for analysis of sales
